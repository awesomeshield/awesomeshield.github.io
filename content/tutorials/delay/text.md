# delay ( )

delay ( ) tells the Arduino to wait for a certain amount of time before following the instruction on the next line of code.

*Inputs:* It takes an input, which is an `int`. This `int` tells the Arduino how long to wait for. It's a number of milliseconds. 1000 milliseconds is the same as 1 second. So `delay(1000)` will wait for 1 second.

#### Tips
delay() is really handy when you want something to happen for a certain amount of time. For example, you could turn a light, usef delay to wait for one second, and then turn it off. Check out the example below to see how.
