# delay ( )

delay ( ) tells the Arduino to wait for a little while before following the instruction on the next line of code.

***

### Inputs
It takes an input, which is an _int_. This _int_ tells the Arduino how long to wait for. It's in milliseconds, so _delay(1000)_ will wait for 1 second.

### Returns
It doesn't return any values.

### Tips
delay() is really handy when you want something to happen for a certain amount of time. For example, you could turn a light, usef delay to wait for one second, and then turn it off. Check out the example below to see how.
