# Buzzer

The buzzer is a very simple speaker. It can make a tone for a certain amount of time. We call this beeping.

***

## Functions

#### awesome.buzzer.*beep()*

The `beep()` function makes a tone.

#### Inputs
The input is an `int`, which is the length of the tone, in milliseconds. So `awesome.buzzer.beep(1000)` will beep for one second.

#### Returns
It doesn't return any variables.

#### Tips
Beeping is useful in projects where you might not be looking at your Awesome Shield, but need to know when something happens.
