# `lcd.setRGB(int R, int G, int B)`

`lcd.setRGB` lets you turn on the LCD screen's backlight.

***

#### Inputs
The backlight is actually an RGB LED. The three inputs (`R` `G` and `B`) are all `int`s that need to be between 0-255. Each letter represents how much red, green, or blue light is mixed into the backlight.

#### Returns
It doesn't return anything.

#### Tips
You can provide more information than just what's written on the screen.
